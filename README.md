## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - [`psutil`](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/) for process monitoring.  
  - [`hashlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) for file hashing.  
  - [`Scapy`](https://scapy.net/) for network packet sniffing.  
- **Platform Requirements**:  
  - Python 3.9+  
  - Npcap (Windows) for network sniffing.
